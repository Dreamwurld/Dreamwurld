Hi Good day, my name is Joseph Sanyaolu, I am a UiUx Designer and I also have extensive knowledge in Graphic Designing.  I design solutions to user pain points by conducting User Research and using User Interface software skills to create visually appealing designs having 4years experience of designing. I have basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.

Bringing my clients ideas to life, accomplishing their goals and in the same vein solving user pain points is my priority.  I will be glad if my request can be favorably granted as I know I would be an asset to your company.  The use of design psychology to create stunning interfaces that make visuals easily interpreted at the lowest level of design by the user no matter the Technicality is what I do. I call it Conceptual Minimalism. I am into Designs that resonate with the company's target Market, with context which when being viewed, directs the users to visualize and interprets a story we want to tell. 

All this channeled through the aid of good design process/principles that produces adaptable and structured User Journey coupled with a quick learning ability, no matter the compatibility. I am that creative touch you need to achieve your Desire. Looking forward to a positive response, have a great day ahead.
